Application Description:
This application is designed as a robust string validation tool intended for use in a wide variety of contexts. The primary function it performs is the validation of user-inputted strings based on several criteria including length, character diversity, and absence of whitespaces. These functions are especially useful in instances where string validation and manipulation are integral, such as password verification, data entry validation, or text formatting operations. The application's modular design makes it suitable for integration into larger projects, as well as for standalone use.

Regex Implementation Description:
The function ValidateString uses regular expressions (regex) to validate if the input string meets specific criteria. It begins by checking the string length, comparing it to the maximum allowed length. Then it utilizes a regex pattern to check the string for lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. This is accomplished with "positive lookaheads" denoted by (?=.*[character-set]) which ensure that at least one character from each set is present in the string. Finally, it checks that the string does not contain any whitespace characters. The regex for this operation is [^\s]{n}$, where n is the length of the string. This ensures that all characters in the string are non-whitespace. The function will return true only if all these conditions are met, and false otherwise.

How to Run the Application Locally:

Ensure you have a .NET environment setup. You can download it from the Microsoft official website if not already installed.
Copy the class Functions with the function ValidateString into a new or existing .NET project. If it's a new project, ensure you include necessary using directives (using System; using System.Text.RegularExpressions;).
In your Main method or elsewhere in your program, call the function ValidateString with a string and an integer representing its maximum length as parameters. For instance: Functions.ValidateString("ExampleString1#", 20);
Compile and run your application. If you're using the .NET CLI, you can compile and run your application with the command dotnet run in the terminal from your project directory.
Check your output. If your string meets all the validation requirements, it will output true, otherwise, it will output false.
